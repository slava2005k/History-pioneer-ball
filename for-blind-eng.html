        <h1>Pioneerball for the Blind</h1>
        <h2 id="1">Game Description</h2>
        <span>
            Pioneerball, also known as sound volleyball or sound volleyball game, is an adapted version of volleyball for blind and visually impaired players. This game is created with consideration for the characteristics of auditory perception and includes special rules and equipment to ensure accessibility and comfort for all participants. A pioneerball team typically includes both blind or visually impaired players and sighted players. A sighted player serves as a guiding voice during the game, helping the team navigate. It's important for the sighted player not to engage in active play to maintain balance and equality of conditions.
